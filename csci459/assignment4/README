to build:

    sh build.sh

this will generate 3 executables:
>   physical_wire
>   data_link_layer
>   network_layer

Run each executable without arguments to see the correct argument order

The executables need to be run in this order:
    1.) physical_wire
    2.) data_link_layer
    3.) network_layer

One additional file is included that contains a series of helper functions to facilitate
TCP socket creation and management. These functions were made by me with some reference
source code from well known online sources  (i.e. GitHub and StackOverflow)

This project was created on my personal computer
OS:   Ubuntu 16.04.5
CPU:  Intel i5-4590, 3.6GHz
GPU:  nVidia GTX 1060

Compiled with
    GCC 5.4.0

As seen in build.sh, no special compiler flags were used
